# Makie

From the japanese word [Maki-e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maki-e), which is a technique to sprinkle lacquer with gold and silver powder.
Data is basically the gold and silver of our age, so lets spread it out beautifully on the screen!

It's Halloween :)

# Installation

This package is not released yet so a bit awkward to set up. Here are the steps:

```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/SimonDanisch/Makie.jl.git")
Pkg.checkout("GLVisualize")
```

Make sure that the check out happens without error. E.e. if you have previously tinkered with GLVisualize, it might happen that you don't check out the `sd/makie` branch correctly.


# Precompilation

You can compile binary for Makie and add it to your system image for fast plotting times with no JIT overhead.
To do that, you need to check out the additional packages for precompilation.
Then you can build a system image like this:

```julia
# add PackageCompiler
Pkg.add("PackageCompiler")
using PackageCompiler
# This is not well tested, so please be careful - I don't take any responsibilities for a messed up Julia install.

# The safe option:
PackageCompiler.compile_package("Makie", force = false) # can take around ~20 minutes

# Replaces julias system image
# please be very carefull with the below option, since this can make your julia stop working.
# If Julia doesn't start for you anymore, consider doing:
# using PackageCompiler; PackageCompiler.revert() <- not well tested

PackageCompiler.compile_package("Makie", force = true)
```
